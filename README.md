# 🙌 Hand Gesture Recognition 
🔹 **Organization**: SkillCraft Technology (Internship Project)  
🔹 **Role**: Machine Learning Intern  
🔹 **Task**: 4

As part of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**, I worked on a basic **hand gesture recognition system** using machine learning algorithms. The goal was to classify hand gestures based on preprocessed image data — without relying on deep learning or heavy image processing techniques.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a lightweight, interpretable ML model capable of recognizing simple hand gestures from grayscale images using traditional classification methods.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

## 📌 Key Learnings

- 🖼️ Converted hand gesture images to grayscale and flattened them into feature vectors  
- 🤖 Applied classical ML algorithms for multi-class classification (e.g., Decision Tree, k-NN, etc.)  
- 📊 Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix  
- 📷 Visualized correct vs. misclassified gestures to analyze model behavior
